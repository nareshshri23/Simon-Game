# 🧠 Simon Game – Memory Challenge

This is a classic **Simon Game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with the help of the **jQuery** library to simplify and shorten the code.

In this game, players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors to test their memory. The game generates a random pattern and the player has to follow it accurately — one mistake, and it’s game over!
